<h2>Alta’s Story</h2>
<p class="muted">
I live in the town of Khovd, but my life is defined by the high Altai. A mother of three, a teacher by training, and a conservationist by heart, I have spent my career at the intersection of nomadic wisdom and modern science. After completing my Master’s in Environmental Science at Melbourne University, I felt a deep pull to return to these landscapes. I realized that the “Mongolian Calmness”—the stillness that protects our nomadic culture and our wildlife—is a treasure that I needed to help preserve.

<h2>Mission</h2>
<div class="prewrap muted">
I see myself as a bridge to the soul of the steppe. My work is rooted in a deep compassion for our nomadic heritage and the animals that live alongside us.

I am building this vision together with my niece, Sun. We are a family team, supported by a close-knit circle of local drivers, translators, and mountain camps who have been part of my journey for years. Together, we invite you to see our home not as a visitor, but as a guest of the Altai mountains.

<!-- SECTION: Itinerary -->
<section class="itinerary">
<h2>Our June Journey: Seven Days in the Altai</h2>
<div class="prewrap muted">
Our journey begins the moment you land at Khovd airport. From there, we leave the town behind and head toward the high Altai. We do not follow a strict hourly itinerary; we let the weather, the light, and the movement of the animals guide our path through the province.

Into the High Altai: We base ourselves in a mountain ger camp situated in the rugged heights, the silent home of the Snow Leopard.

The Shore of a Prehistoric Sea: We travel to Durgun Lake where sand dunes meet deep water.

Ancient Galleries: We trek to rock art sites dating back over 20,000 years.

The Steppe & The Sky: We cross the plains of Khomiin Tal National Park.

The Waters of Khar Us Nuur: Vast reed beds alive with movement.

I am Sun, Alta’s niece and the bridge between our home in the Altai and the world beyond.

Based in Brisbane, Australia, since 2017, I work as a Physiotherapy Assistant at the Mater Hospital.

While Alta is our expert on the ground, I manage the logistics that make these expeditions possible.
