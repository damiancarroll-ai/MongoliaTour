    <h2>Alta’s Story</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      I live in the town of Khovd, but my life is defined by the high Altai. A mother of three, a teacher by training, and a conservationist by heart, I have spent my career at the intersection of nomadic wisdom and modern science. After completing my Master’s in Environmental Science at Melbourne University, I felt a deep pull to return to these landscapes. I realized that the “Mongolian Calmness”—the stillness that protects our nomadic culture and our wildlife—is a treasure that I needed to help preserve.

    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <div class="prewrap muted">
I see myself as a bridge to the soul of the steppe. My work is rooted in a deep compassion for our nomadic heritage and the animals that live alongside us.

I am building this vision together with my niece, Sun. We are a family team, supported by a close-knit circle of local drivers, translators, and mountain camps who have been part of my journey for years. Together, we invite you to see our home not as a visitor, but as a guest of the Altai mountains.

    <h2>Our June Journey: Seven Days in the Altai</h2>
    <div class="prewrap muted">
Our journey begins the moment you land at Khovd airport. From there, we leave the town behind and head toward the high Altai. We do not follow a strict hourly itinerary; we let the weather, the light, and the movement of the animals guide our path through the province.

Into the High Altai: We base ourselves in a mountain ger camp situated in the rugged heights, the silent home of the Snow Leopard.

The Shore of a Prehistoric Sea: We travel to Durgun Lake where sand dunes meet deep water.

Ancient Galleries: We trek to rock art sites dating back over 20,000 years.

The Steppe & The Sky: We cross the plains of Khomiin Tal National Park.

The Waters of Khar Us Nuur: Vast reed beds alive with movement.

I am Sun, Alta’s niece and the bridge between our home in the Altai and the world beyond.

Based in Brisbane, Australia, since 2017, I work as a Physiotherapy Assistant at the Mater Hospital. My professional background is rooted in care and clear communication—values that are essential when helping guests prepare for a journey as significant as this one.

While Alta is our expert on the ground, I manage the logistics that make these expeditions possible. I have a deep love for the outdoors and a passion for sharing the 'Mongolian Calmness' of my homeland with others. My goal is to ensure your transition from the modern world to the high mountains is seamless, organized, and personal.

If you have questions about the terrain, what to pack, or the details of our June exhibition, I am here to help in both English and Mongolian.

We invite you to reach out to discuss the finer details of this June exhibition. We believe a conversation is the best way to start a journey.
